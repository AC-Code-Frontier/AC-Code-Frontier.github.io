In today’s world, technology touches nearly every corner of our lives, shaping how we work, communicate, and even represent ourselves. Among the countless digital tools we use, social media stands out as a powerful force that’s changing how we connect with others, both personally and professionally. While platforms like Instagram and TikTok might come to mind for fun and creativity, there’s another side to social media that’s all about growing your career and opening new doors.
